# Sea Level Predictor

## Project Overview
The Sea Level Predictor is a Python-based application designed to analyze and visualize the rise in sea levels over time. Using historical data, this project employs the Matplotlib and SciPy libraries to create scatter plots and linear regression lines to predict future sea levels. The visualizations provide insights into the trends of sea level rise from 1880 to 2050, helping users understand the potential impacts of climate change.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and reading CSV files.
Matplotlib: Employed to create scatter plots and line graphs.
NumPy: Incorporated for numerical operations and range generation.
SciPy: Utilized for linear regression analysis to determine trends in the data.
This project illustrates the significance of data analysis in understanding environmental changes, enabling users to visualize the projected rise in sea levels and assess the implications for coastal areas.
